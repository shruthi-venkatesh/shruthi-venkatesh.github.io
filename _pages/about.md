Welcome! I am an Economist in the Antitrust Division of the [Bureau of Economics](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/bureau-economics) at the [U.S. Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftc.gov/). I received my PhD from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2024. My research focuses on competition in health care markets, provider incentives, and health outcomes.
