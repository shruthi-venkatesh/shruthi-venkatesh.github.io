**Job Market Paper** 
*Draft Coming Soon* 
Abstract: Consolidation between hospitals and physician practices is a ubiquitous feature of health care markets across the US. This paper examines the impacts of hospital-physician prac- tice acquisition on physician referrals, hospital prices, and welfare using detailed administrative claims data from the Massachusetts APCD. I find that the effects vary substantially across dom- inant and non-dominant hospital systems in the state. Among non-dominant hospitals, acquisi- tion leads to a 20 percentage point increase in within-system referral rates and to higher hospital prices. In contrast, physician practice acquisition by a dominant hospital does not meaningfully shift referrals nor raise negotiated prices. To rationalize these empirical observations, I develop a bargaining model of competition and use the estimates to evaluate the effects of changes in physician practice ownership. The model demonstrates how changes in referral demand due to practice consolidation enhances the bargaining leverage of the acquiring hospital system. I then simulate the hospital acquisition of every physician practice in the state, and I find that hospital prices increase by $198.58 per admission, though effects are larger across non-dominant firms. Higher payments to hospitals decrease insurer surplus. Patient welfare declines due to shifts in physician referrals post-acquisition.
